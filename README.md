## Templates

### .NET Aspire MCP Server and Client (`dao-aspire-mcp`)

Full-featured .NET Aspire application with Model Context Protocol server and Blazor client.

## .NET Aspire Sql Server MCP (`dao-sql-mcp`)

.NET Aspire application that hosts a [Data Api Sql Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-api-builder/mcp/overview) to provide access to a database in a governed and managed way.

## .NET Aspire + Angular (`dao-aspire-angular`)

.NET Aspire application with an Angular frontend and C# API, ready for cloud deployment with `azd up`. Uses the backend-serves-frontend model — in dev mode Angular runs separately with a proxy, in production a single container serves both the API and the Angular static files.

**Options:**
- `--IncludeSignalR true` — adds a `NotificationHub` to the API and a live notification badge service + component to the Angular app (proxied via `/hubs` with WebSocket support).

## .NET Aspire with EF (`dao-aspire-ef`)

.NET Aspire application that has Entity Framework Core with a migration service created to quickstart apps with the needed infrastructure.

## .NET Aspire with Avalonia Desktop (`dao-aspire-avalonia`)

.NET Aspire application with an Avalonia MVVM desktop app and C# API. Uses `IHost` for dependency injection, a typed `IApiService` for HTTP communication, and the Aspire `IsRunMode` pattern to inject the API base URL into the desktop app at startup.

## .NET Aspire with Expo (React Native) (`dao-aspire-expo`)

.NET Aspire application with an Expo React Native mobile app and C# API. Aspire orchestrates the Metro bundler via `AddJavaScriptApp` in dev mode and passes the API base URL via `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL`.
